Habit Tracker App - Complete Technical Documentation
Project Overview
You're building a sophisticated desktop habit tracker application using Electron that helps users create, manage, and track habits with flexible scheduling and smart organization features. The app combines the power of Node.js backend logic with a web-based frontend interface.
Core Architecture
Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
Backend Logic: Node.js modules with require/export system
Desktop Framework: Electron (evidenced by Node.js requires in browser context)
Data Storage: Local JSON file persistence
File Structure: Modular architecture with separate concerns

Key Components
1. Habit Class (Habit.js)
The core data model containing 19 properties:

Identity: id, title, projectId, createdDate
Scheduling: frequencyType, intervalday, customdays, startDate, nextDue
Progress Tracking: currentStreak, totalCompleted, completionHistory, lastCompleted
State Management: isActiveToday, isActive
Enhancement Features: counter, incrementation, notes, priority

2. Storage System (storage.js)

File-based persistence using habits.json
CRUD operations: saveHabit(), readHabits(), removeHabit(), writeHabits()
Data integrity: Converts plain JSON back to Habit class instances
Backward compatibility: Handles missing properties in existing data

3. Date Calculation Engine (dateUtils.js)
Sophisticated scheduling logic with multiple functions:

calculateNextDue(): Initial due date calculation (starts today)
calculateNextDueAfterCompletion(): Post-completion scheduling
recalculateNextDueFromStart(): Recalculates from habit start date
Custom weekday handling: getNextValidWeekday(), getNextValidWeekdayAfterCompletion()
Streak management: checkIfCustomWeekdaysStreakBroken()

4. Frontend Interface (renderer.js)

Dynamic form management: Shows/hides sections based on frequency type
Real-time habit display: Updates UI when habits change
Edit modal system: In-place editing with validation
Smart checkbox logic: Handles completion/undo based on due status

Frequency Types & Scheduling Logic
1. Daily Habits

Due every single day
Simple streak calculation (missed day = broken streak)
Next due: tomorrow after completion

2. Interval Habits

Due every X days (user-defined interval)
More forgiving streak logic (grace period)
Next due: current date + interval days

3. Custom Weekdays

Due only on specified days of the week
Complex streak logic (checks for missed valid days)
Most sophisticated scheduling algorithm

Current Features (Phases 1-4)
‚úÖ Completed Core Features

Habit Creation: Full form with all frequency types
Start Date Support: Habits can begin on future dates
Progress Tracking: Streaks, counters, completion history
Edit Functionality: Complete modal-based editing
Delete Operations: Safe habit removal
Smart Validation: Prevents interaction with non-due habits
Undo System: Reverse completions if needed
Auto-streak Management: Automatically breaks streaks when missed

‚úÖ Data Persistence

JSON file storage with full state preservation
Backward compatibility for existing data
Proper class instantiation from stored data

‚úÖ Advanced Scheduling

Multiple frequency types working correctly
Proper next-due calculations
Start date respect (habits don't appear before start date)
Post-completion scheduling logic

Current Phase: Phase 4 - Bug Fixes & Requirements Validation
What You're Currently Working On:

Fixing edge cases in date calculations
Ensuring streak logic works correctly for all frequency types
Validating completion/undo functionality
Testing start date behavior thoroughly
Resolving any UI/UX inconsistencies

Known Areas of Focus:

Custom weekday streak calculations
Start date validation and enforcement
Completion checkbox state management
Next due date accuracy after edits

Upcoming Development Phases
Phase 5: Smart Scheduling üéØ
Goal: Habits only appear when they're actually due

Hide non-due habits from main view
Today's Due Habits section
Upcoming Habits preview
Overdue Habits warning system
Filter/view options (all habits vs due today)

Phase 6: Project Organization üìÅ
Goal: Group habits by projects/topics

Project creation system
Project assignment for habits
Project-based views and filtering
Project progress summaries
Multi-project management

Phase 7: UI/UX Enhancement üé®
Goal: Professional, intuitive interface

Modern CSS framework integration
Responsive design principles
Visual progress indicators (charts, graphs)
Dark/light mode toggle
Improved animations and transitions
Better mobile experience (if applicable)

Technical Strengths of Current Implementation
Excellent Architecture Decisions:

Modular design with clear separation of concerns
Class-based data modeling with comprehensive properties
Sophisticated date logic handling edge cases
Flexible frequency system supporting various patterns
Robust storage system with data integrity
Smart UI state management based on habit status

Advanced Features Already Working:

Start date enforcement (habits respect future start dates)
Automatic streak breaking when habits are missed
Undo functionality for accidental completions
Dynamic form sections based on frequency selection
Real-time UI updates after any data change
Counter system with custom incrementation

Data Flow Summary

Creation: User fills form ‚Üí createHabit() ‚Üí Calculate initial nextDue ‚Üí Save to JSON
Display: Load habits ‚Üí Check due status ‚Üí Update streaks ‚Üí Render with appropriate controls
Completion: User clicks checkbox ‚Üí Validate due status ‚Üí Update progress ‚Üí Recalculate nextDue ‚Üí Save
Editing: User opens modal ‚Üí Pre-populate form ‚Üí Save changes ‚Üí Recalculate schedules ‚Üí Refresh display

Current State Assessment
Your app is remarkably sophisticated for a personal habit tracker. The scheduling logic rivals commercial apps, and the modular architecture sets you up perfectly for the remaining phases. The foundation is solid, and you're at the right point to polish Phase 4 before moving to smart scheduling.
